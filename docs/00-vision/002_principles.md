# Principles

    1. **Bounded autonomy**: agents can act, but only within explicit constraints.
    2. **No invisible side effects**: tools run through adapters with audit logs.
    3. **Replay > vibes**: actions emit events so runs can be reproduced.
    4. **Policy is code**: rules are enforceable and testable.
    5. **Observability-first**: tracing and structured logs are not optional.
