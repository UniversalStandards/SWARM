# Overview

PROJECT SWARM is a modular framework for orchestrating multiple AI agents with explicit boundaries and safety controls.

Key design goals:
    1. Predictable orchestration (scheduling, routing, lifecycle)
    2. Explicit tool access (allowlists) + policy gate
    3. Replayable runs (event sourcing)
    4. Observability by default
    5. Evaluation harness to prevent regressions
